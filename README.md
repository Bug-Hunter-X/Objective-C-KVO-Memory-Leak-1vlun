This repository demonstrates a common error in Objective-C: a memory leak caused by improper handling of Key-Value Observing (KVO). The `bug.m` file contains code that adds a KVO observer but fails to remove it, resulting in a retain cycle. The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version that properly removes the observer to prevent the memory leak. This is a crucial aspect of memory management in Objective-C, and neglecting it can lead to performance issues and crashes in applications.
